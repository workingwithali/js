    <h1>What is a Promise?</h1>
    <p>A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its
    resulting value.</p>
    <h1>States of a Promise</h1>
    <p>A promise has three states:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>
        <li>Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, resulting in a resolved value.</li>
        <li>Rejected: The operation failed, resulting in a reason for the failure.</li>
    </ol>
